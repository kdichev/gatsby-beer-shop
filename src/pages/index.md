  title: Why Høkeren?
  description: >
    Hokeren is the beer store for everyone who believes that great beer
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beer
    directly from small scale sustainable breweries and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.
description: Hokeren is the ultimate spot for beer lovers who want to learn
  about their beer’s origin and support the small breweries that grew it. We
  take beer production and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone. We want to keep the traditions that made the Danish beer
  so famous.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
